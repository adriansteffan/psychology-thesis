# Papaja Project for Thesis Manuscript

A self contained R Markdown project that produces the final thesis manuscript using [papaja](https://frederikaust.com/papaja_man).

For easier shareability, all datafiles have been copied to this folder and analysis files have been adjusted to fit into the papaja workflow.
All files in this folder render without relying on outside files of the repository, and in turn, other parts of the repository do not rely on any of the files in this folder.

Important: unzip `inlab_data.csv.zip` in `./data/` before running the analysis/knitr.
